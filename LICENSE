Parameters

Licensor:             Jace Studios, Inc. dba Virtues
Licensed Work:        Virtues
                      The Licensed Work is (c) 2025 Jace Studios, Inc. dba Virtues
Additional Use Grant: You may make production use of the Licensed
                      Work, provided that you do not use the Licensed
                      Work for a Hosted Service or a Commercial
                      Hardware Product.

                      A "Hosted Service" is a commercial offering
                      that allows third parties (other than your
                      employees and contractors acting on your behalf)
                      to access the functionality of the Licensed Work
                      as a managed service.

                      A "Commercial Hardware Product" is a hardware
                      device, appliance, or pre-installed system
                      distributed with the Licensed Work for
                      commercial resale.

                      For the avoidance of doubt, the following uses
                      are permitted:

                      (a) Use by an individual for personal,
                          non-commercial purposes, including
                          self-hosting on personal hardware or
                          infrastructure;

                      (b) Use by any organization for its own internal
                          operations, including self-hosting on
                          organization-owned or leased infrastructure;

                      (c) Use by a consultant or contractor to
                          install, configure, or maintain the Licensed
                          Work on behalf of an end user described in
                          (a) or (b);

                      (d) Non-commercial educational and research use.

                      The following uses require a separate commercial
                      license from the Licensor:

                      (i)   Operating the Licensed Work as a hosted,
                            managed, or cloud service offered to third
                            parties;

                      (ii)  Distributing, bundling, or pre-installing
                            the Licensed Work on hardware devices or
                            appliances intended for commercial resale;

                      (iii) Offering the Licensed Work as part of a
                            platform, marketplace, or service where
                            end users can access its functionality
                            without obtaining their own license.

Change Date:          Four years from the date of each version's
                      first public release.
Change License:       Apache License, Version 2.0
