Thanks for your patience as we work to find a new meeting time that works for the whole cohort.

Based on the feedback so far, here are the proposed time slots (all in Central Time):
- Monday 3:00 PM CT
- Tuesday 3:00 PM CT
- Wednesday 3:00 PM CT
- Wednesday 8:00 AM CT

Please reply to this email with any times that DON'T work for you, and I'll select the best option once I hear from everyone.

For context, we want to maintain our weekly fellowship meetings while ensuring maximum participation.
