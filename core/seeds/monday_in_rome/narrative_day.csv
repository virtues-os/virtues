"Monday November 10, 2025 in Rome, Italy. Attended the AI & Ethics conference at the Vatican. Around mid-morning, randomly ran into Jacob from my venture cohort at a café. He was with his wife, Lucy. We ordered croissants and coffee while catching up. Jacob mentioned he's from the San Antonio area in Texas and was heading back to Dallas after the conference. It was great to finally meet in person after knowing each other through the cohort. Later in the day, enjoyed local wine (Montepulciano) and continued exploring Rome's cafés and restaurants.",day,2025-11-10 00:00:00+00,2025-11-10 23:59:59+00,day,0.90,seed-manual-v1,manual_seed_adam,v1
