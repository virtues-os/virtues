title,description
Perfectionism,Getting stuck in endless refinement instead of shipping
Distraction,Context-switching and losing focus on important work
People-pleasing,Saying yes to requests that drain energy and misalign with priorities
Comparison,Measuring progress against others instead of personal growth trajectory
Rushing,Moving too quickly without proper reflection and consideration
