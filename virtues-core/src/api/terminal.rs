// WebSocket <-> in-process PTY bridge
//
// The terminal tab in the web UI opens a real login shell on *this* machine.
// We spawn a PTY directly (no sshd, no localhost SSH round-trip): the shell
// runs as whatever user the server process runs as — `virtues` on a box, the
// developer in local dev. Same code path everywhere.
//
// The PTY runs a tmux *client* attached to a long-lived session, not the shell
// itself. The shell (and anything long-running in it — `claude`, a build, a
// migration) is a child of the tmux *server*, which outlives this websocket.
// So a closed tab, a slept laptop, or a dropped iroh path detaches instead of
// killing the work, and the next connection reattaches to the same screen. If
// tmux isn't installed we fall back to a plain login shell, which behaves as
// before: disconnect kills it.
//
// portable-pty is thread-based (blocking reader/writer), so we bridge to the
// async websocket through channels: a reader thread pumps PTY output into a
// bounded mpsc the select loop drains, and a writer thread drains input the
// loop feeds it. The select loop keeps the master so it can resize, and kills
// the child on disconnect so no clients leak.

///   set when the pane is born, which matters: `default-terminal` and
///   `history-limit` are read at pane creation, so setting them afterwards would
///   strand the first pane on `screen` with 2000 lines of history forever.
/// - Reattaching: no `new-session` at all. Both `-A -d` and a bare `-d` *fail*
///   against an existing session ("open terminal failed" / "duplicate session"),
///   and a failing command aborts the rest of the list. The server is already up,
///   so the options just get re-asserted.
///
/// - `default-terminal` is the $TERM programs inside tmux see, and `Tc` is what
///   tells tmux the outer terminal — xterm.js — takes 24-bit colour, which it
///   does. Neither is inferable: verified on tmux 3.4 that COLORTERM=truecolor
///   alone does *not* get RGB into the client's terminal features.
///   `screen-256color` over `tmux-256color` because the latter's terminfo entry
///   is missing on minimal images.
/// - `mouse` makes the wheel scroll tmux's history. Without it the wheel does
///   nothing at all: tmux owns the screen, so xterm's own scrollback never
///   fills and there is nothing under the viewport to scroll to.
/// - `history-limit` defaults to 2000 lines, which would silently truncate well
///   before the 10k scrollback the frontend advertises.
/// - Right-click otherwise opens tmux's own context menu, which inside a browser
///   reads as the page being broken; unbinding it gives the browser's menu back.
///   `unbind-key` on an already-unbound key is a no-op, so this stays idempotent.
///
