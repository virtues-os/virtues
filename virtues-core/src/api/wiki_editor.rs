//! The wiki editor: one role, one constitution, one brief per subject kind.
//!
//! Design: `agents/plan/article-resolution-plan.md`. How the prompts are
//! organized and why: `agents/build/wiki-editor.md`.
//!
//! This module holds the parts that are pure functions of text — prompt
//! assembly, the lede, provenance, and the invariant the server enforces on
//! every machine edit. They are here rather than inside the applet because
//! they are the half of article resolution that can be tested without a model,
//! a CRDT or a scheduler, and because the invariant is the thing that makes
//! two pens on one article safe.
