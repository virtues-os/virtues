//! Pair-only auth bootstrap.
//!
//! One primitive — a short-lived 24-byte random token in `app_pair_token` —
//! grants the right to enroll a device. The token never carries any
//! long-lived secret; the redeeming device generates its own keypair (for
//! WG-capable devices) and submits the pubkey when consuming.
//!
//! Mint paths — one model: an authenticated mint is `authorized`.
//!   - CLI (`virtues pair`): minted on the box itself; trusted by physical
//!     access. Used for first-pair and recovery.
//!   - Web ("+ Add Device" from a paired browser): minted by the
//!     already-authenticated owner, so it's authorized in the same call (same
//!     justification as the collector). The old `pending` → `/confirm`
//!     round-trip was friction with no security gain for a QR the owner scans
//!     on their own screen, so it was removed. Cancel an outstanding token via
//!     `POST /api/pair/deny/:id` (the modal fires it on close).
//!
//! Consume path (`POST /api/pair/consume`)
//!   - Accepts `{token, kind, label, device_info, device_node_id?}`.
//!   - For `kind = mobile_app | desktop_app | sensor | cli`: creates a device
//!     row (recording the device's iroh `node_id` for the allowlist) + a
//!     `credentials` row with a server-issued bearer (HMAC-lookup, encrypted at
//!     rest). Reach is over iroh — no WG bundle.
//!
//! Status path (`GET /api/pair/status/:id`) — RFC 8628-shaped polling that the
//! "+ Add Device" modal hits to know when the new device has finished.
//!
//! Token storage: SHA-256(token) is persisted; the raw token only exists in
//! the response that goes back to the client + the QR URL. Atomic
//! single-use semantics via `UPDATE … WHERE status = 'authorized' RETURNING`.
