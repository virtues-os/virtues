//! api_key-authenticated client for the virtues-api routes.
//!
//! Attaches the box's device api_key (from the credential vault) on every call.
//! No renewal — the key is stable; the wallet behind it is credited
//! server-side. On a `wallet_empty` 402 it triggers one auto-top-up via atlas
//! (which charges the card + credits the wallet) and retries; other 402s
//! (wallet_expired) and 401 (unknown_key → re-link) surface to the caller.
//!
//! Use this for the proxy routes (`/v1/ai/*`, `/v1/places/*`, `/v1/parallel/*`,
//! `/v1/unsplash/*`).
//!
//! ## The BYO fork
//!
//! When the user has set a BYO provider key, **every `/v1/ai/*` call** leaves
//! by the user's endpoint instead of ours — streaming via [`Self::stream`],
//! non-streaming via [`Self::post_json`]. Both consult
//! [`crate::api::settings_byo::load_byo_credential`] and divert before any
//! bearer is read, so virtues-api (wallet, markup, caps, auto-top-up) is out
//! of the inference path entirely. That is the whole point of BYO.
//!
//! The fork is keyed on [`is_ai_path`] — the same predicate that decides cost
//! capture — rather than on a separate `post_ai()` method, specifically so a
//! new AI caller cannot forget to opt in. That mattered: until 2026-08-05
//! only `stream()` honored the key, and compaction, day summaries, image
//! generation and transcription quietly billed the wallet while the UI said
//! "BYO active". Non-AI routes (`/v1/places/*`, `/v1/parallel/*`, `/v1/unsplash/*`)
//! are per-user vendor bills that BYO says nothing about, so they keep going
//! through the wallet. Plan of record: `docs/byo-ai-plan.md`.
//!
//! ## Purpose tagging (vestige — no-op)
//!
//! Calls still carry an `X-Virtues-Purpose` header (`user`/`system`), but the
//! server **ignores** it — the old OS-reserve / chat-wallet two-pool split was
//! removed when billing collapsed to a single wallet. `Purpose` +
//! `with_purpose()` are kept only so background callers don't have to change;
//! they have no billing effect and the whole thing is safe to delete later.
