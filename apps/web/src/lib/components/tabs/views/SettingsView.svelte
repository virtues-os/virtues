	SettingsView.svelte

	The one Settings room. A single door in the sidebar opens here; every
	preference and console lives under it as a route-driven section. Replaces the
	former two rooms (Account + System) and the flat footer folder
	(Sources · Tools · Profile · Devices · System · Developers · Sign Out).

	Doctrine: one tab group max. The primary sub-nav (the nouns the user owns) is
	the only nav for most sections; only Developer carries a secondary sub-nav,
	and nothing nests a tab group inside a tab group.

	  You          /virtues/you            — profile, theme
	  Assistant    /virtues/assistant      — name, persona, model
	  Plan         /virtues/plan           — subscription, balance, and the
	                                         AI calls and background runs that
	                                         draw it down
	  System       /virtues/system         — the machine, measured (read-only)
	  Network      /virtues/network        — which network the box is on
	  Software     /virtues/software       — release, track, update, artifacts
	  Devices      /virtues/devices        — paired devices (Unpair, Start over)
	               /virtues/devices/this   — the machine you're on (local panel)
	               /virtues/devices/:id    — another device, as the box knows it
	  Display      /virtues/display        — the screen on the box, and what it shows
	  Developer    /virtues/developer      — SQL · Terminal · Lake

	"Box" was three of those in one door (2026-08-17). It stacked a Wi-Fi
	picker, an update installer, an 8-chapter telemetry console and a
	revoke-every-device button on a single scroll — a reading, two settings and
	a detonator sharing one scrollbar — and the console's own "Network &
	Devices" and "About" chapters answered questions the two sections above
	them had already answered differently. Splitting it by subject is what
	removes the duplication; it was never really one room.

	There is no "Sign out" — auth is the device's proven iroh key, not a server
	session. The destructive action is Unpair, and it lives next to the thing it
	destroys (Devices) — which is also why "Start over", the plural of Unpair,
	moved there out of Box.

	Legacy flat/nested routes (/virtues/account, /virtues/connections/*,
	/virtues/box/devices, /virtues/developer/console, …) self-heal on mount.
